# MyTradingApp
This is an application for keeping track of all your beloved stocks. 
MyTradingApp provides a graphical way to display stock data, which includes price, news, trends and an personal watchlist and more.

My motivation behind the creation of this app, is that i have got tired of stock apps that are to complex and has a ugly UI-design. 

The goal of this app is to be as user friendly as possible and have a nice mordern UI design.
